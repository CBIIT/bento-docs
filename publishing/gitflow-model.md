# Versioning and Git Branching and Tagging

For now, the approach is to use the `master` branch for the current, latest release of Bento documentation, and then create a separate branch for each release. This will allow easy maintenance/updating of different versions of documentation. This may change.

See `source/conf.py` for specific information on whitelisting tags and branches.

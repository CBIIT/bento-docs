# Welcome to Bento-tools documentation

Things to note: Documentation for Bento-tools

* [Template and Documentation Instructions](https://cbiit.github.io/bento-docs/reference/template)


* Download: <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CBIIT/bento-docs/master/reference/template.md">template.md</a>

## Caveat Emptor
* Search not working at moment
* This documentation is not yet finished
* After the markdown file is pushed to the repo, it can take 10 to 15 minutes for the changes to appear
* you can nest pages in sub-directories, but a second-level will not appear in the navigation menu in the sidebar, but you can still see it in the breadcrumbs at the top

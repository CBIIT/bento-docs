# Overview

Bento is a software framework being built to support NCI’s Data Commons projects, including Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), and Clinical Trial Data Commons (CTDC).

## Introduction
Bento is an open-source framework that supports the creation of data sharing platforms that allow users to store, manage, share and analyze large-scale data according to the FAIR principles.
<br>Bento is built on three organizing principles:
<br>1. **Bento is data agnostic.** You can use Bento to develop data sharing platforms for data types of your choice. The framework is built to support the sharing of any kind of large scale biological data, be it next-generation sequencing, , proteomics, flow-cytometry or single-cell sequencing data sets.
<br>2. **Bento is modular.** The Bento architecture separates the front-end code, back-end code and the underlying graph database into three separate modules. This modularity allows users to separately update each module. For example, the database model may be updated and the resulting database will work with the other modules to form a functioning application, or the front-end code may be updated to provide a different user interface, without modifying the back-end or database modules. We believe this modularity allows Bento-enabled data sharing platforms to be scaled up and out to keep pace with the platform custodian’s evolving needs.
<br>3. **Bento is cloud enabled.**We have built Bento to be deployed on your in-premise servers, as well as on the Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud platforms. 

<br>This site provides you with the background and instructions you need to set up your own data sharing platform using Bento.

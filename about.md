## Intro
Add and commit markdown files to this repo, then push to github to see your changes.  The webserver auto-regenerates your site when a file is pushed.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`Title.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## Code Snippets
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
```
